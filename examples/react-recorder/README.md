# Recorder example

Example project to show how to use the `@itslanguage/recorder` package. Also
with different media types.

## Getting started, TL;DR

1. Clone the [itslanguage sdk](https://github.com/itslanguage/itslanguage-js.git) repository;
1. Navigate to the specific example in the examples directory;
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`;
1. Run `npm run start` or `yarn run start`;

The example should now be available via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Additionally for mobile

If it is required or wanted to access the example from safari on iOS use the
`start:https` command in stead of the `start` command.

1. Run `npm run start:https` or `yarn run start:https`;

The example should now be available via
[https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000). Change `localhost` to the
ip-address if requested from mobile.
