All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `api`
  - Only unregister an autobahn registration if there is actually an
    registration registered.
  - Reset the `lastChunk` after it is used.
  - Really cleanup some event listeners on the recorder after they have been
    used for streaming audio to the backend.
  - TypeError raised by makeWebsocketCall.
  - Allow to pass groups as a string (next to an array) and disallow other
    types. This is for the getById function of the Progress API.

### Changed

- `api`, `recorder`, `player`, `examples`, `sdk`
  - Bumped used package versions.
  - Upgraded yarn.lock file.

## [v5.2.0] - 2019-12-19

### Added

- `recorder`
  - Added a new plugin: BufferPlugin. This plugin buffers the microphone input
    for a given number of seconds. It also exposes an api to get (part of) the
    buffer.
- `examples`
  - Added the `react-recorder-buffer` example. This example shows an example of
    the recorder with buffer plugin enabled.

### Changed

- `recorder`

  - Updated the recorder readme file to be more accurate.

### Fixed

- `api`
  - Fix the stability of the test by taking the asynchronous approach that was
    used into account.

## [v5.1.0] - 2019-09-27

### Added

- `api`
  - Better inform the user when the recorder is prepared and ready to process
    audio. We now send out an `recorderready` event if ready.
- `examples`
  - Added the `react-speechchallenge` example. This example shows a speech
    challenge example and uses the recorder to record audio for it. It is also
    possible to listen back to the recorded audio.

### Changed

- `api`
  - The `dataavailable` and `stop` event that will be used by the sdk to send
    data to the backend will now remove the event handlers upon adding them.
    Just the handlers that it would add. This to make sure the recorder can be
    reused in stead of just once.
  - Before registering an RPC to the autobahn session, all the current
    registered functions will be unregistered, if there are any. This to make
    sure only one registration is active at the time.
  - The broadcaster event `websocketserverreadyforaudio` is a bit confusing.
    Sending it through the event emitter is deprecated and will be removed in a
    future version.
- `sdk`
  - Updated .gitignore file with more common patterns.

## [v5.0.1] - 2019-08-29

### Fixed

- `player`
  - Bumped the peer dependency of player to the correct `api` version.

## [v5.0.0] - 2019-08-29

### Changed

- `api`, `recorder`, `player`, `examples`, `sdk`
  - Bumped used package versions.
  - Upgraded yarn.lock file.
  - Set core-js@3 as peerDependency.
- `recorder`
  - Allow the default browser media types for recording, not just `audio/wav`.
    This can be done through the `mimeType` param on the `createRecorder`
    function.

### Fixed

- `recorder`
  - Failing test after bumping versions. Fixed by using non hardcoded value for
    the recorder getSpecs call.

### Added

- `examples`
  - Added the `react-recorder` example. This example shows how the recorder can
    be used.

### Removed

- `recorder`
  - The `addAsGlobal` function is removed.
  - The signature for `createRecorder` is changed. The params `setToWindow` and
    `asObject` are removed.
  - Several exported defaults are removed.

## [v4.2.2] - 2019-08-13

### Fixed

- `recorder`
  - The `recorder.getAudioSpecs()` was returning some hard-coded values that
    where not true on some devices. If the recorded and processed audio sounded
    like it was speedup: this was why.

## [v4.2.1] - 2019-06-21

### Changed

- `api`
  - Allow multiple writes for speech recordings by using the `timeslice` feature
    of the recorder.

## [v4.2.0] - 2019-04-17

### Added

- `api`, `recorder`, `player`, `examples`, `sdk`
  - Added prettier to the project.
- `recorder`
  - Made it possible to load plugins.
  - Added the Amplitude plugin.
- `examples`
  - Add an example project to demonstrate the `AmplitudePlugin`.

### Changed

- `api`, `recorder`, `player`
  - Bump dependencies to the latest available versions.
  - Update babel config to make use of the latest babel features.
