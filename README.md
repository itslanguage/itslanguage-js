# ITSLanguage JavaScript SDK

Speech technology for language education. ðŸ“£

The ITSLanguage JavaScript SDK aims to help in building applications for the [ITSLanguage] platform.
It provides easy interfaces to communicate with our [REST and WebSocket API]. We serve several
packages through the [npmjs.com] ecosystem that can be used together. See the table below for all
the packages we deliver.

| Package name                              | Description                          |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| [recorder](packages/recorder/README.md)   | ITSLanguage compatible MediaRecorder |
| [websocket](packages/websocket/README.md) | ITSLanguage Socketio helper          |

Besides npm an umd build of each package is also available on unpkg.com.

| Package name                              | npm                      | unpkg                                    |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| [recorder](packages/recorder/README.md)   | [@itslanguage/recorder]  | [unpkg.com/@itslanguage/recorder/dist/]  |
| [websocket](packages/websocket/README.md) | [@itslanguage/websocket] | [unpkg.com/@itslanguage/websocket/dist/] |

## Installation

All the available packages of the SDK will be distributed as npm packages. Package managers that can
can work with the [npmjs.com] registry, like [npm] and [yarn] do, can be used to add SDK packages to
your project. For simplicity this readme assumes [npm] as package manager.

Adding ITSLanguage packages into your project is as easy as instructing [npm] to do so. In the case
of npm this will automatically add an entry in your package.json file. If that does not happen, you
are probably using an older [npm] version (< 5.x). Consider upgrading to at least > 5.x.. Note that
ITSLanguage publishes its packages scoped, which means that all packages should be prefixed with
`@itslanguage/PACKAGE_NAME`.

```bash
# Example installation of the recorder package
npm install @itslanguage/recorder
```

**note**: As shown in the table above, all the packages are also published as an UMD bundle via
[unpkg.com]. This makes it possible to install or download the packages _without_ [npm]. All needed
dependencies will also be bundled for convenience. See the example below to get an idea on how to
use it.  
We do recommend usage with a package manager like [npm] or [yarn] though.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Some page title</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@itslanguage/api@v5.0.0/dist/api.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      // The api is now available through global `itslApi`.
      itslApi.createItslApi();
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello, world!
  </body>
</html>
```
