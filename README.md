The ITSLanguage JavaScript SDK aims to help in building applications for the [ITSLanguage] platform.
It provides easy interfaces to communicate with our [REST and WebSocket API]. We serve several
packages through the [npmjs.com] ecosystem that can be used together. See the table below for all
the packages we deliver.

| Package name                            | Description                                                                        |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [api](packages/api/README.md)           | Implements the interface to the ITSLanguage backend as described in our [API docs] |
| [player](packages/player/README.md)     | ITSLanguage compatible HTMLAudioElement                                            |
| [recorder](packages/recorder/README.md) | ITSLanguage compatible MediaRecorder                                               |

Besides npm an umd build of each package is also available on unpkg.com.

| Package name                            | npm                     | unpkg                                   |
| :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| [api](packages/api/README.md)           | [@itslanguage/api]      | [unpkg.com/@itslanguage/api/dist/]      |
| [player](packages/player/README.md)     | [@itslanguage/player]   | [unpkg.com/@itslanguage/player/dist/]   |
| [recorder](packages/recorder/README.md) | [@itslanguage/recorder] | [unpkg.com/@itslanguage/recorder/dist/] |

## Installation

All the available packages of the SDK will be distributed as npm packages. Package managers that can
can work with the [npmjs.com] registry, like [npm] and [yarn] do, can be used to add SDK packages to
your project. For simplicity this readme assumes [npm] as package manager.

Adding ITSLanguage packages into your project is as easy as instructing [npm] to do so. In the case
of npm this will automatically add an entry in your package.json file. If that does not happen, you
are probably using an older [npm] version (< 5.x). Consider upgrading to at least > 5.x.. Note that
ITSLanguage publishes its packages scoped, which means that all packages should be prefixed with
`@itslanguage/PACKAGE_NAME`.

```bash
# Example installation of the api package
npm install @itslanguage/api
```

**note**: While we describe usage like installing packages through [npm], the ITSLanguage SDK itself
has been build as a so called monorepository managed by [yarn workspaces]. For using the SDK in your
project [yarn] is not a requirement! You can use the package manager which is most comfortable for
you and your project.

**note**: As shown in the table above, all the packages are also published as an UMD bundle via
[unpkg.com]. This makes it possible to install or download the packages _without_ [npm]. All needed
dependencies will also be bundled for convenience. See the example below to get an idea on how to
use it.  
We do recommend usage with a package manager like [npm] or [yarn] though.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Some page title</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@itslanguage/api@v5.0.0/dist/api.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      // The api is now available through global `itslApi`.
      itslApi.createItslApi();
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello, world!
  </body>
</html>
```

## Package usage
